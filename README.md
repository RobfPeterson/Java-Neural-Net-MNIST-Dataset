This was the final assignment for a data science and algorithms class in my senior year of high school. 
I coded a basic feedforward neural net in java which used backpropagation to train and analysed the mnist data sets. 

This could be optimized further by adjusting the number of nodes in each layer. However, it served its primary function as a framework for basic neural nets.
