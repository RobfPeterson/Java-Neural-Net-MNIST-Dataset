I coded a basic feedforward neural net in java which used backpropagation to train and analysed the mnist data sets. 

This could be optimized further by adjusting the number of nodes in each layer. However, it served its primary function as a framework for neural nets. It did help build my understanding of the mathematics behind machine learning and highlighted design architectures effect on effiecency.
